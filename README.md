**OVERVIEW:**

This assignment is an integral component of the *Developing Data Products* course contained within the *Data Science Specialization* offered by Johns Hopkins University at <http://www.coursera.org>. I am a student enrolled in the complete specialization program and it my pleasure to share my work. If I can be of any further assistance, I can be reached here via <http://github.com> or via my personal website at <http://koolwebdezign.com>.

**OBJECTIVES:**

The purpose of this series of exercises is to demonstrate my ability to develop data products using R Studio and its host of contributed pacakges.

Within the objectives of this exercise, I will achieve the following:

1. publish a very simple R markdown presentation document (with custom CSS) - [My Fancy Presentation](https://koolwebdezign.github.io/data-products/My_Fancy_Presentation.html)

2. publish a map-based visualization using the Leaflet R package - [My Leaflet Example](https://koolwebdezign.github.io/data-products/My_Leaflet_Example.html) 

3. create a very simple model for the construction of a R package (see topten folder)

4. publish an R markdown presentation using Plotly [My Plotly Presentation](https://koolwebdezign.github.io/data-products/My_Plotly_Presentation.html)
