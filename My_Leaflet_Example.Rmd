```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

# The following notes were extracted from Coursera
# This series of code is the same as the piping notation below
# my_map = leaflet()
# my_map = addTiles(my_map)

# Piping notation for code sample above
# my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

# Create my map with setView() in order to set map center and zoom level
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-70.9746, 41.9870, zoom = 17) %>% addMarkers(-70.9746, 41.9870, popup="Hello BSU World!")



# Output the map
my_map
